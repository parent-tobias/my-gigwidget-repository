Instrumental intro
{chorus}
[D7]Look for the [G]bare necessities, the [C]simple bare necessities,
[G]Forget about your [E7]worries and your [A7]strife [D7]
I[G] mean the [G7]bare necessities, old [C]Mother Nature's [C7]recipes,
that [G]brings the [E7]bare ne[A7]cessi[D7-alt]ties of [G]life [C7] [G]

Wherever I [D7]wander, wherever I [G]roam,
I couldn't be [D7]fonder of my big [G]home
The [G7]bees are [C]buzzin' in the [Cm]tree,
To make some [G]honey just for [A7]me
When [Em7]you look under the [E7]rocks and plants,
and [Am7]take a glance at the [D7]fancy ants,
Then [G]maybe try a [E7]few [E7]
The bare ne[Am7]cessities of [D7]life will come to [G]you

{chorus}
[D7]Look for the [G]bare necessities, the [C]simple bare necessities,
[G]Forget about your [E7]worries and your [A7]strife [D7]
I[G] mean the [G7]bare necessities, they're [C]why a bear can [C7]rest at ease,
with [G]just the [E7]bare ne[A7]cessi[D7-alt]ties of [G]life [C7] [G]

Now when you pick a [D7]pawpaw, or a prickly [G]pear,
And you prick a [D7]raw paw, the next time [G]beware -
Don't [G7]pick the [C]prickly pear by the [Cm]paw,
When you pick a [G]pear, try to use the [A7]claw.
But [Em7]you don't need to [E7]use the claw
When [Am7]you pick a pear of the [D7]big pawpaw
Have [G]I given you a [E7]clue? [E7]
The bare ne[Am7]cessities of [D7]life will come to [G]you...
they'll [D7]come to [G] you!

Instrumental verse, lines 1 â€“ 4

So just [D7]try and relax, yeah cool it, fall apart in my backyard.
Cause let me tell you [G]something, little britches.
If you [D7]act like that bee acts, [G]uh uh, you're working too hard [G7]
And don't spend your [C]time lookin' a[Cm]round,
For something you [G]want that can't be [A7]found
When [Em7]you find out you can [E7]live without it,
And [Am7] go along not [D7]thinkin' about it.
I'll [G]tell you something [E7]true - [E7]
The bare ne[Am7]cessities of [D7]life will come to [G]you.
