# GigWidget TAB Sharing Thingummy

## The What

So the idea behind this, I wanted to create a music sharing app that does other stuff. By music sharing, I specifically mean being able to share ChordPro files with other users P2P, to be able to view the song as a readable TAB sheet, to display chord charts, to be able to transpose or edit the song and see those changes reflected to users real-time.

Further plans for it include:

* Building set lists.
* Connecting to a calendar/event system, and binding set lists to an event.
* Creating custom chord charts (preferred user or song settings).
* Creating custom riffs or chord progressions.
* Creating notes related to chords, songs, sets, events, progressions... anything should be note-able.
* Other features to come, **waaay** down the line.
